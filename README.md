# Srikanth_Portfolio

My Data Science Portfolio including Projects that I completed, which are solving a particular business problem or introducing a new product/algorithm. All projects contain python codes and you can get an overview through the write up. 
# [Project 1: Predicting a Bank Customer Exit Rate using ANN:](https://github.com/srikanthv0610/Artificial-Neural-Network_Predicting-BankCustomer-ExitRate)

*Why* To estimate the churn rate of a bank customer in order to identify customers that are likely to leave the company and try to encourage them to stay by various marketing tools.

*How* Using customer behavour data to analyse the different parameters and train Artifical Neural Network (ANN) to predict the probability of each customer leaving the company.

# [Project 2: Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression:](https://github.com/srikanthv0610/Logistic_Regression-Heart_Disease_Prediction) 

Usin the heart dataset [here](https://github.com/srikanthv0610/Logistic_Regression-Heart_Disease_Prediction/blob/main/Dataset), I have designed this model for:
* Analysing the different variables and finding relations and insights using descriptive statistical analysis technique
* Data Preprocessing
* Splitting the data into train and test sets
* Using Logistic Regression algorithm to train a model and to predict heart disease
* Analysing the Models performance

## Analysing the Categorical Variable with respect to our target variable

## Analysing the Continuous Variable with respect to our target variable

# [Project 3: Social Media-Marketing Prediction: Analysing and Visualizing the Performance of Different Classifiers:](https://github.com/srikanthv0610/ClassificationModel_Compairing-ModelPerformance-of-Different-Classifiers)

* Design and compare performance of different classification models. We design the model to predict which customer would buy a product based on different parameters. 

## Classification Models:

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine
* Naive Bayes
* K-Nearest Neighbour
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest

## Visualizing the Classification of the different models:
