# [Project 1: Predicting a Bank Customer Exit Rate using ANN:](https://github.com/srikanthv0610/Artificial-Neural-Network_Predicting-BankCustomer-ExitRate)

* The dataset used for modelling our prediction model can be found [here](https://github.com/srikanthv0610/Artificial-Neural-Network_Predicting-BankCustomer-ExitRate/tree/main/Dataset)

* Applying Data Preprocessing: Data Transformation, Data Normalization and Splitting into Train and Test Set
* Modelling an ANN by Selecting appropriate model parameters
* Using the ANN model to Predict the Banks Overall Churn rate as well as an individual customers probability of exiting 
* Evaluating the model performance using Accuracy score and Confusion Matrix

# [Project 2: Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression:](https://github.com/srikanthv0610/Logistic_Regression-Heart_Disease_Prediction) 

Usin the heart dataset [here](https://github.com/srikanthv0610/Logistic_Regression-Heart_Disease_Prediction/blob/main/Dataset), I have designed this model for:
* Analysing the different variables and finding relations and insights using descriptive statistical analysis technique
* Data Preprocessing
* Splitting the data into train and test sets
* Using Logistic Regression algorithm to train a model and to predict heart disease
* Analysing the Models performance
