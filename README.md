# [Project 1: Predicting a Bank Customer Exit Rate using ANN:](https://github.com/srikanthv0610/Artificial-Neural-Network_Predicting-BankCustomer-ExitRate)

* The dataset used for modelling our prediction model can be found [here](https://github.com/srikanthv0610/Artificial-Neural-Network_Predicting-BankCustomer-ExitRate/tree/main/Dataset)

* Applying Data Preprocessing: Data Transformation, Data Normalization and Splitting into Train and Test Set

* Modelling an ANN by Selecting appropriate model parameters

* Using the ANN model to Predict the Banks Overall Churn rate as well as an individual customers probability of exiting 

* Evaluating the model performance using Accuracy score and Confusion Matrix
