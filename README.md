# Srikanth_Portfolio

My Data Science Portfolio contains Projects that I completed, which are solving a particular business problem or introducing a new product/algorithm. All projects contain python codes and you can get an overview through the write up. 
# [Project 1: Predicting a Bank Customer Exit Rate using ANN](https://github.com/srikanthv0610/Artificial-Neural-Network_Predicting-BankCustomer-ExitRate)

**Why:** To estimate the churn rate of a bank customer in order to identify customers that are likely to leave the company and try to encourage them to stay by various marketing tools.

**How:** Using customer behavour data to analyse the different parameters and train Artifical Neural Network (ANN) to predict the probability of each customer leaving the company.

# [Project 2: Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/srikanthv0610/Logistic_Regression-Heart_Disease_Prediction) 

**Why:**  Heart disease can be predicted based on various symptoms such as age, gender, heart rate, etc. Machine learning algorithms play an essential and precise role in the prediction of heart disease. This would help to reduce the death rate of heart patients. 

**Steps:**
* Analysing the different variables and finding relations and insights using descriptive statistical analysis technique
* Data Preprocessing
* Splitting the data into train and test sets
* Using Logistic Regression algorithm to train a model and to predict heart disease
* Analysing the Models performance

## Analysing the Continuous Variable with respect to our target variable

# [Project 3: Social Media-Marketing Prediction: Analysing and Visualizing the Performance of Different Classifiers](https://github.com/srikanthv0610/ClassificationModel_Compairing-ModelPerformance-of-Different-Classifiers)

**Why:** Design and compare performance of different classification models. The models gives us an estimation on which customer would buy a product based on different parameters. 

## Classification Models Used:

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine
* Naive Bayes
* K-Nearest Neighbour
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest

## Visualizing the Classification of the different models:

# [Project 4: House Price Prediction with Linear Regression](https://github.com/srikanthv0610/House_Price_Prediction)

**Why:** To estimate the house prices for helping people who plan to buy a house so they can know the price range in the future and plan their finance well. In addition, house price predictions are also beneficial for property investors to know the trend of housing prices in a certain location.

**Steps:**

* Used the AmesHousing dataset [here](https://github.com/srikanthv0610/House_Price_Prediction/edit/main/Dataset) compiled by Dean De Cock.
* Apply Feature Transformation, Feature Selection and K-fold Cross Validation.
* Linear Regression to Predict the House Prices.
